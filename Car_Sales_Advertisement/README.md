In this notebook, we will make use of some famous libraries used in **R - dplyr, tidyverse, ggplot & vtree** to perform data anlysis (EDA).

My goal during **EDA** is to develop an good understanding of the data. The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation. When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset and helps you decide which graphs, models or transformations to make.
