In this notebook, we will make use of some famous libraries used in **R - dplyr, tidyverse, ggplot & vtree** to perform data anlysis (EDA).

My goal during **EDA** is to develop an good understanding of the data. The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation. When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset and helps you decide which graphs, models or transformations to make.

**Background Information**

This dataset contains car sale advertisements which was collected for study/practice purposes in **2016**. Though there is couple well known car features datasets they seems quite simple and outdated. Car topic is really interesting. This dataset contains data for more than 9.5K cars sale in **Ukraine**. Most of them are used cars so it opens the possibility to analyze features related to car operation. At the end of the day I look at this data as a subset from all **Ukrainian** car fleet.
